        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Dr. Klaus Lackner is the director of Center for Negative Carbon Emissions and professor at the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment of the Ira A. Lacknerâ€™s research interests include closing the carbon cycle by capturing carbon dioxide from the air, carbon sequestration, carbon foot-printing, innovative energy and infrastructure systems and their scaling properties, the role of automation, robotics and mass-manufacturing in downscaling infrastructure systems, and energy and environmental policy.

        <h2 class="title-font text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">What did he make?</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Klaus lackner made an artificial tree that captures carbon dioxide directly from the air. This help by reducing carbon emmisions and greenhouse gasses because like trees it also takes in Carbon dioxide and reduces global warming. It uses artificial leaves, theat are 1000 times more effecient than real leaves that use photosynthesis. These leaves contain resins that bind with carbon dioxide molecules. The leave form a kind of sail, designed to snatch the greenhouse gas out of the air as wind blows through the contraption. He calls this material a <strong>synthetic tree</strong>.

        <h2 class="title-font text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">What it does</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Carbon dioxide levels increase because of pollution from cars, vehicles, and much more. And it causes issues like acid rain, global warming, melting of glaciers and even diseases! At about 2006 the amount of Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 02%. But unfortunatly, we have rapidly raised the levels to about 04% from that time to now. If we don't change our path, we will face big problems like land falls and we might make life on earth very hard. So this recyclable and efficient material might change our future if it works.</p>
